1. Create git repo and clone it in local
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it.(it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initialized dvc.
# pip install dvc
4. How we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .doc) 
5. Now we do "mkdir s3" (create a new s3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
    Now it will ask to do: (git rm -r cached 'data' "and" git commit -m "stop tracking data")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for dvc to handel.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now- "dvc comit" and then "dvc push"
10 do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage at first virsion of data.
11. Now make changes in mycode.py to append a new row in data , check changes via "dvc status"
12. Now- "dvc comit" and then "dvc push"
13 do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage at second virsion of data.
